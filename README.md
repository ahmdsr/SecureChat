# SecureChat
Zero-Storage Secure Messaging
I have a running version of this exact code on yapto.me for general usage


## 🛠️ Built With
- Node.js (because JavaScript everywhere, why not?)
- Express (the fast food of web frameworks)
- Socket.IO (keeping those yaps real-time since 2010)
- Love (and a bit of caffeine)

## 🤫 Privacy Features
- No message storage (what happens in Yap, stays in Yap)
- No tracking (we're not your ex)
- No history (like that time you tried to cut your own hair)

## 📜 License
MIT License (because sharing is caring)

## 🤝 Contributing
Got ideas? Found a bug? Want to make it even cooler?
1. Fork it (like a boss)
2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Open a Pull Request (and cross your fingers)

## ⚠️ Warning
Side effects may include:
- Excessive chatting
- Random bursts of laughter
- Temporary addiction to dark mode
- Sudden urge to share memes
- Increased productivity (results may vary)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
- Coffee (our true MVP)
- Cursor
- ~20$
